#Write a for loop that prints every third number from 1 to
#mystery_int inclusive (meaning that if mystery_int is 7, it
#prints 1, 4, and 7). Print each number on a separate line.
#Hint: There are multiple ways to do this! You might use the
#modulus operators, or you could use the third argument for
#range().
